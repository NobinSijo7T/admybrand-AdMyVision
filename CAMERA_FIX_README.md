# 📱 COMPLETE FIX: "navigator.mediaDevices is undefined" Error

## 🚨 URGENT: Camera Streaming Issue Fixed!

The **"navigator.mediaDevices is undefined"** error occurs because modern browsers require **HTTPS** or **localhost** for camera access when connecting from mobile devices to remote servers.

## ✅ WORKING SOLUTION (Choose the best option for you):

### 🔒 Solution 1: HTTPS (RECOMMENDED & MOST RELIABLE)

**✅ This is now set up and working!**

The application is running with HTTPS at:
- **🔗 HTTPS URL:** `https://192.168.1.3:8502`
- **📱 Use this URL on your phone for guaranteed camera access**

```bash
# The app is already running with HTTPS using:
python -m streamlit run pages/3_fixed_object_detection.py --server.port=8502 --server.sslCertFile=cert.pem --server.sslKeyFile=key.pem
```

**📱 On your phone:**
1. Open browser (Chrome or Safari)
2. Go to: `https://192.168.1.3:8502`
3. Accept the security warning (self-signed certificate)
4. Grant camera permissions when prompted
5. ✅ Camera should work immediately!

### 📱 Solution 2: Chrome Flags (Android Only)

**If you prefer HTTP instead of HTTPS:**

1. Open Chrome on Android
2. Type: `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`
3. Add: `http://192.168.1.3:8502`
4. Set to "Enabled"
5. Restart Chrome
6. Access: `http://192.168.1.3:8502`

### 🔌 Solution 3: USB Debugging (Advanced)

```bash
# Connect phone via USB, enable USB debugging, then:
adb reverse tcp:8502 tcp:8502

# Access on phone via: http://localhost:8502
```
